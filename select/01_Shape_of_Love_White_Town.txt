Here's the best I can do
So far away from you
As the ocean holds the sky
So I try to hold your eyes

And I know the world is turning
I know it's yesterday for you
But the shape we're giving love
Could never be untrue

Choose the way you want to be
That doesn't mean him or me
Love is so much more that flesh
How to hurt and how to kiss

And I know the world is turning
I know it's yesterday for you
But the shape we're giving love
Could never be untrue

I wish I'd known you when
I could have made a change
I would have been a friend
I would have given you anything

As you touch near your heart
Are we really far apart?
Yes I know distance kills
But it can't fight love's will

And I know the world is turning
I know it's yesterday for you
But the shape we're giving love
Could never be untrue

And we know the world is turning
We know that yesterday is due
But this shape we're giving love
Can never be untrue
This shape can never be untrue
