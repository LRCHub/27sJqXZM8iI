I only came inside to get out of the rain
And by the looks of things
She may well have done the same
Well I swear I know that face
But I don't know her name
She's the shape of love
Oh
I stir my tea, I throw away wet cigarettes
I watch her shivering in her rain sodden dress
I know her makeup runs
And her hair may be a mess
But she's the shape of love
And I don't ever, want the rain to stop
I don't ever, want to leave this coffee shop
I don't ever, want the clouds to part
'Cause the shape of love is the only shape that fits my heart
I only came inside, to get out of the wind
Now I'm here, let it blow
Yeah, let sing
'Cause I don't know how this ones going to end
Or how it may begin
But she's the shape of love
I don't ever, want the sun to shine
I don't ever, want to leave this one behind
I don't ever, want the summertime to start
'Cause the shape of love is the only shape that fits my heart
Oh, no
I don't ever, want the rain to stop
I don't ever, want to leave this coffee shop
I don't ever, want the clouds to part
'Cause the shape of love is the only shape that fits my heart
I don't' ever, want the sun to shine
I don't ever, want to leave this one behind
I don't ever, want the summertime to start
'Cause the shape of love is the only shape that fits my heart
